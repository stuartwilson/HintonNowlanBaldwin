# HintonNowlanBaldwin

Hinton and Nowlan's demonstration of the Baldwin Effect in a computational model, and derivative code.

This code is based on the model described in the paper:

Hinton GE, Nowlan SJ (1981) How Learning Can Guide Evolution. Complex Systems. 1(3):495â€“502.

This code uses the json and h5 libraries via the morphologica library and you will need to install any dependencies for morphologica by following the instructions at https://github.com/ABRG-Models/morphologica.git.

Once you've done that clone this repo, and in this directory also clone morphologica:

```
git clone https://github.com/ABRG-Models/morphologica.git
```

Then you can build the project: 

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
```

To run the simulation:

```
./build/hinton config.json logs
```

(optionally append a seed for the random number generator)

When the simulation finishes, and logs/out.h5 has been created, you can do:

```
python analysis.py
```

(optionally provide the path to an alternative version of logs/out.h5)
